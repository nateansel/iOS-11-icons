# iOS-11-icons
A collection of reproductions of all the stock iOS 11 icons in Sketch.

Feel free to use any of these icons in your own projects, mockups, or just as a fun reference!

I'm still very much a beginner in Sketch, so there may be a few small differences in these recreations and the actual icons. That said, this project is being made using screenshots of iOS 11, so they should be pretty close.

If you have any suggestions, create an issue, and if you have any fixes or tweaks, create a pull request.
